## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwarshb/chaitalk.git
```

### 2: Open the project and Setup API Keys in App.kt
```bash
val firebaseAPIKey : MutableState<String> = remember {  mutableStateOf(YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY")}
val firebaseDatabaseUrl = remember {  mutableStateOf("https://yourprojectdatabaseurl.firebaseio.com/") }
val STORAGE_URL = "YOUR FIREBASE STORAGE URL"
val geminiKey = remember { mutableStateOf("YOUR GEMINI API KEY") }

var geminiModel : MutableState<String> = remember { mutableStateOf("gemini-2.0-flash") }

firebase.initialize(apiKey = firebaseAPIKey.value,
            databaseUrl = firebaseDatabaseUrl.value,storageUrl = STORAGE_URL)
firebase.setGemini(geminiModel.value,geminiKey.value)

```
### 3; Run the project

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that‚Äôs common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple‚Äôs CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if you‚Äôre sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.
